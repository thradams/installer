Visual Studio C Project to create windows installers
(Just initial commit)


The idea is to create a setup project that embeds zip files and then extract these files
and make changes in windows register.

In my view this is useful to create installers using C/C++ language instead
crazy scripts. This also gives us a high level of customization and the setup
will not depend on anything else that is not already present (visual studio).
